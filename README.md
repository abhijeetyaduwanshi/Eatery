Eatery is a responsive restaurant management website.
Both Customers and Owner can use the website.
The customers can reserve a table and seats, likewise the owner can login to manage the other parts of the restaurant as admin.
Front end role and task based entities. NO BACK END.
Fully functional responsive website.

There are 2 pages in the website.

The first page is the index page. Whenever we go to the website the first thing that comes up is the customers reservation tab.
The customers tab, customers are welcomed with a custome form to enter their details and book the table.
They have to enter the date and time they want to visit, with this they have to enter their full name, contact number, email address, number of guests in their party and any special needs.
They can then reserve a spot. There is an option to change the existing reservation.
The owners tab is the second part of the page.
This is for the owner where they can login with their username and password.
There is an option to recover passsword in case they forgot the password.

The second page is for the owner with five tabs namely reservations, seatings, profile, app settings and contacts.
The reservations tab is for the owner to see the details of the customers with their name, date and party size.
The owner can then click the details button and see full details of the customers.
At the very top of the page is a search bar to search a customer with their name. I have used pagination.
The seatings tab has two sections in the page where the left section have a list of all the tables with size, availability status, booking time and confirmation number. Where as the right section have the table arrangements.
The third tab on the page is profile tab where the owner can further login to see the financial details.
The fourth and fifth tabs on the page are app settings and contacts tabs.
App settings and Contacts tabs are empty for now.
